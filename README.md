# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project explores machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

Data Prep:

We import pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
Data from CSV files is loaded and split into training and testing sets.
Exploration & Cleaning:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations helps us understand the data, identify trends/outliers, and explore feature relationships.
Missing values are addressed, irrelevant features removed, and potentially new features created to enhance the model.
Model Building & Evaluation:

We train and evaluate various machine learning models (Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to find the most accurate predictor of survival.
Making Predictions:

The chosen model predicts survival outcomes on unseen test data.
A submission file is created to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data.
Conclusion:

Our model achieves a 81.6 % accuracy (update with your actual accuracy) in predicting survival rates, demonstrating its effectiveness. This project showcases machine learning's application to historical data, offering insights into factors that may have influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
